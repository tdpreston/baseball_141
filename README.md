# baseball_141

baseball_v1.r has the process of how I created all the new data but you can download the .csv instead and just use baseball_DL_stuff.r to save some time

Here is the link to download the data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADv_TZVTDzEeVRvzCuA-WZuZiLuUKBye/view?usp=sharing

It's ~300mb after you unzip
